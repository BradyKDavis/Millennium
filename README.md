# Millenium -  If Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Unity had a child

This is a engine/game framework/whatever you like to call it I'm making for fun and to make it easier for other people to create Paper Mario: TTYD-based fangames.
I didn't really document anything, but many of the function and variable names should be pretty self-explanatory. At least that's what I hope.

To use/contribute, fork this project and clone your fork to anywhere on your computer. Next open Unity, click "Add" and choose the folder you cloned Millenium in. Give it some time to load and you're good to go!

If you just want a demonstration of the current features, you can download a prebuilt demo here:

The demo may be outdated, it's currently on commit #90785a8.
(Controls aren't set by default at the moment though, you'll have to press the [ESC] key and click "Reset to defaults", then press [ESC] again. This will be improved in the future as part of the settings menu)

My goal with this project is to provide a relatively easy-to-use and modern alternative to programs like Star Rod. It is still fairly early in development, but it's here if you want to check it out anyways, just be aware that there can and will be changes that may break your code if it's interacting with mine!

If you need help with anything just open an issue or @ me at Twitter (@ToadsworthLP).
I also have a discord server where you can discuss about Millenium: https://discord.gg/GK3uMuB

Also, I obviously don't own/am affiliated with Super Mario, Paper Mario, Nintendo, Intelligent Systems, Reggie and his memes or anything else which isn't my code.
