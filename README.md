# Millenium -  what happens if Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Unity had a child

This is a engine/game framework/whatever you like to call it I'm making for fun and to make it easier for other people to create Paper Mario: TTYD-based fangames.
I didn't really document anything, but many on the function and variable names should be pretty self-explanatory. At least that's what I hope. :^)

To contribute, fork this project and clone your fork to anywhere on your computer. Next open Unity, click "Add" and choose the folder you cloned Millenium in. Give it some time to load and you're good to go!

If you need help with anything just open an issue or @ me at Twitter (@Toadsworth1507).
